### Principles

#### The barrier for entry should be low.  

Stack authors should be able to provide little information if they wish to. However, stack authors may want to 
support extreme details about how to run an application with network policies! Both ends of the spectrum must be supported.

#### The stack spells out the "what" but not necessarily the "how"

As an example, stack authors may want to specify that they expect a BuildPacks-v3 build strategy to be used to turn source code
into an image. However, it is upto the tool to figure out how to execute a BuildPacks-v3 build based on the inputs provided.
